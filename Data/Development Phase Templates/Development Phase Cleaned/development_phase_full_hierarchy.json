  "3.6.1. Description": "During the Development Phase, the system developer takes the detailed design information documented in the previous phase and transforms it into machine-executable form, and ensures that all of the individual components of the Business Product function correctly and interface properly with other components within the system/application. As necessary and appropriate, system hardware, networking and telecommunications equipment, and COTS/GOTS software is acquired and configured. New custom-software programs are developed, database(s) are built, and software components (COTS, GOTS, and custom-developed software and databases) are integrated. Test data and test case specifications are finalized. Unit and integration testing is performed by the developer with test results appropriately documented. Data conversion and training plans are finalized and user procedures are baselined, while operations, office and maintenance procedures are also initially developed. The Development Phase ends with a Stage Gate Review to determine readiness to proceed to the Test Phase.",

  "3.6.3. Activities": "The Development Phase includes several activities that are the responsibility of the developer. The developer places the outputs under configuration control and performs change control. The developer also documents and resolves problems and non-conformances found in the Business Product and tasks. The developer selects, tailors, and uses those standards, methods, tools, and computer programming languages that are documented, appropriate, and established by the organization for performing the activities in the Development Phase. ENTERPRISE PERFORMANCE LIFE CYCLE FRAMEWORK Plans for conducting the activities of the Development Phase are developed, documented and executed. The plans include specific standards, methods, tools, actions, and responsibility associated with the development and qualification of all requirements including safety and information security. Separate plans may be developed. Verify that the Business Product covering the documented and baselined requirements in is a sufficient state of readiness for integration and formal testing by an assigned test group (i.e. other than development personnel). During the Development Phase, the final Test Plan is prepared. In addition, final drafts of the following project deliverables are developed: • Business Product • Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Manual, describing the Business Product, operating environment, production processing requirements, ongoing maintenance activities, and problem tracking and change management procedures. • Systems Security Plan, addressing system managerial, technical, and operational information security controls • Security Risk Assessment, documenting the analysis of information security functional requirements, threat impacts, and system protection requirements. • Training Plan, describing overall goals and learning objectives; activities to develop, conduct, control, and evaluate training; and staff resource requirements. • Training Materials, comprising all artifacts used to train system end users, such as instructor and student guides, audio and visual aids, computer-based and other media. • User Manual, explaining how a business user operates the system.",

This includes instructor and student guides, audio-visual aids, and computer- based or other media used to disseminate information about the final product to the target audience that is in need of the instruction.",
    "Security Risk Assessment (SRA) A Security Risk": "Assessment will document the analysis of the (Final Draft) information security functional requirements and will identify the protection requirements for the system using a formal risk assessment process. The risk assessment includes the identification of threats to and vulnerabilities in the information system; the potential impact or magnitude of harm that a loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability would have on agency assets or operations and the identification and analysis of information security controls for the information system.",

  },
  "3.6.6. Project Reviews": "Two project reviews will be conducted during the Development Phase. The first is the Validation Readiness Review (VRR). The VRR is conducted to provide assurance that the Business Product that is about to enter validation (system) testing has completed thorough unit/module/software integration testing during the development of the Business Product and is ready for turnover to the formal, controlled test environment where validation testing will be conducted. The scope of the VRR is to inspect the test products and test results obtained during development testing for completeness and accuracy, and to verify that test planning, test cases, scenarios, and scripts provide adequate coverage of documented system requirements. In addition, a review of the test environment, test setup, and test data is performed to ensure they are adequately prepared for validation testing. The second review is the Independent Verification & Validation Assessment. An IV&V Assessment is conducted by an independent third party to identify potential improvements that may not be apparent to those working directly on a project, or identify problems before they occur and thus avoid loss and minimize the cost of any necessary corrective action. IV&V Assessment also provides management with an independent perspective on the full scope of project activities, from planning through implementation.",
